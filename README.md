## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.x)
- Python (v3.11 or lower) (required for `node-gyp` to build native modules, python 3.12 is not supported)

## Starting Development

### Environment Setup

Before running the application, set up the necessary environment variables:

1. Clone the repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/TuringGpt/trace.git
   cd trace
   ```
2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
3. Add the following variables to the `.env` file (modify values as needed):
   ```plaintext
   MODE='development'
   BLOB_STORAGE_URL='DefaultEndpointsProtocol=http;AccountName=devstoreaccount1;AccountKey=Eby8vdM02xNOcqFlqUwJPLlmEtlCDXJ1OUzFT50uSRZ6IFsuFq2UVErCz4I6tq/K1SZFPTOtr/KBHBeksoGMGw==;BlobEndpoint=http://127.0.0.1:10000/devstoreaccount1;'
   ```
   development mode will skip uploading files to cloud storage.
4. Install the application dependencies (use **node version 18**)
   ```
   npm install
   ```
5. Install azure cli. follow [instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) for your platform.
6. Verify azure cli installation.
   ```
   az version
   ```
7. Install azurite for local development. azurite is used to create local azure blob storage for testing purpose. we're creating `azure-blob-storage` folder in project root which will be used to mimic upload recordings.
   ```
   npm i -g azurite
   azurite-blob -l ./azure-blob-storage
   ```
8. Create Blob storage container using azure cli.
   ```
   az storage container create --name turing-videos --connection-string "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=http;AccountName=devstoreaccount1;AccountKey=Eby8vdM02xNOcqFlqUwJPLlmEtlCDXJ1OUzFT50uSRZ6IFsuFq2UVErCz4I6tq/K1SZFPTOtr/KBHBeksoGMGw==;BlobEndpoint=http://127.0.0.1:10000/devstoreaccount1;"
   ```
9. Start the application in development mode.
   ```
   npm start
   ```
